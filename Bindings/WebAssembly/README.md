# Δoxa Binarization Framework - WebAssembly

## Introduction
This is an **experimental** project that exposes the ΔBF, written in C++, to JavaScript via WebAssembly.  It works both server side and client side.  For a simple example of how it works, checkout the [WebJS](../../Demo/WebJS) and [NodeJS](../../Demo/NodeJS) demos.
