# Matlab POC - !!Completely Unstable!!!

## Introduction
Doxa is an image binarization library focussing on local adaptive thresholding algorithms. In English, this means that it has the ability to turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image.

## Overview
This Doxa Matlab library uses the Î”oxa Binarization Framework for quickly processing images in Matlab.

**Build & Test**
```
cmake -S . -B ./build
cmake --build ./build --config Release
ctest
```

**Matlab Example**
```matlab
% Example grayscale image
originalImage = imread('example.jpg');
outputImage = rgb2gray(originalImage);

% Optional parameters
params.windowSize = 74
params.k = 0.25;

% Perform the binarization
ImageBinarization.updateToBinary(
    outputImage, 
    ImageBinarization.SAUVOLA, 
    params
);

% Display the result
imshow(binaryImage);
```
