    "```\n",
    "pip install doxapy\n",
    "```\n",
    "Form more details, see: https://pypi.org/project/doxapy\n",

    "Alternatively, you can build the library from source as described in the README.MD.\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, it is as simple as importing the library.  NumPy and Pillow are two other libraries we will use in this demonstration."

    "## Reading an Image\n",

    "\n",
    "DoxaPy was developed around PyBind 11 and the C++ based Doxa library, making it incredibly fast and efficient.  That said, not every aspect of the Doxa framework has been exposed to Python.  For example, the first step for many binarization algorithms involves color to grayscale conversion.  A lot of effort has gone into understanding the impact of different grayscale algorithms and their effect on binarization performance.  This is one aspect that is not directly exposed in DoxaPy, but is worth considering.  Here, we are using Pillow's \"L\" option to convert the image to grayscale which uses a \"ITU-R 601-2 luma transform.\"  This is the same as Doxa's BT601 function found in Grayscale.hpp."

    "## Converting the Image to Binary\n",
    "Converting an image into black and white may seem easy, but it has been the focus of much research spanning decades.  Doxa was designed to expose this research, traditionally mired by PHD technical jargon, in a very easy to consume fashion.  A lot of work was put into ensuring these algorithms were implemented correctly and effeciently.  Many of these algorithms were first made public by this project and many of them leverage state of the art enhacements to reduce memory utilization and increase speed of operation, found nowhere else.  For more information on an individual algorithm, click one of the links below.\n",

    "### Algorithms\n",
    "The Doxa library implements a large number of popular and unique local adaptive binarization algorithms.  Each algorithm has a set of parameters that are required for it to operate.  These parameters can vary from algorithm to algorithm.  Doxa provides sensible defaults that are applied automatically unless you supply your own.  Below is a list of algorithms and their defaults:\n",
