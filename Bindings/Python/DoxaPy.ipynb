    "From there, it is as simple as importing the library.  NumPy and Pillow are two other libraries we will use in this demonstration."

    "## Converting the Image to Binary\n",
    "Converting an image into black and white may seem easy, but it has been the focus of much research spanning decades.  Doxa was designed to expose this research, traditionally mired by PHD technical jargon, in a very easy to consume fashion.  A lot of work was put into ensuring these algorithms were implemented correctly and effeciently.  Many of these algorithms were first made public by this project and many of them leverage state of the art enhacements to reduce memory utilization and increase speed of operation found nowhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "The Doxa library implements a large number of popular and unique local adaptive binarization algorithms.  Each algorithm has a set of parameters that are required for it to operate.  These parameters can vary from algorithm to algorithm.  Doxa provides sensible defaults that are applied automatically unless you supply your own.  Below is a list of algorithms and their defaults:\n",
