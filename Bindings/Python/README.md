# DoxaPy

## Introduction
DoxaPy is an image binarization library focussing on local adaptive thresholding algorithms. In English, this means that it has the ability to turn a color or gray scale image into a black and white image.

## Overview
DoxaPy uses the Î”oxa Binarization Framework for quickly processing python Image files.

### Example
This short demo uses DoxaPy to read in a color image, converts it to binary, and then compares it to a Ground Truth image in order to calculate performance.

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import doxapy

def read_image(file):
    return np.array(Image.open(file).convert('L'))


# Read our target image and setup an output image buffer
grayscale_image = read_image("2JohnC1V3.png")
binary_image = np.empty(grayscale_image.shape, grayscale_image.dtype)

# Pick an algorithm from the DoxaPy library and convert the image to binary
sauvola = doxapy.Binarization(doxapy.Binarization.Algorithms.SAUVOLA)
sauvola.initialize(grayscale_image)
sauvola.to_binary(binary_image, {"window": 75, "k": 0.2})

# Calculate the binarization performance using a Ground Truth image
groundtruth_image = read_image("2JohnC1V3-GroundTruth.png")
performance = doxapy.calculate_performance(groundtruth_image, binary_image)
print(performance)

# Display our resulting image
Image.fromarray(binary_image).show()
```

### Alternative Calls
DoxaPy can very efficiently reuse the same memory buffer for converting a grayscale image to binary.  Unless you are constantly changing algorithm parameters for the same image, it is recommended that you call this method.

```python
# Transforms the grayscale image buffer into binary with a single call
doxapy.Binarization.update_to_binary(doxapy.Binarization.Algorithms.NICK, grayscale_image)
```


## Building and Test
DoxaPy supports 64b Linux, Windows, and Mac OSX on Python 3.x. Starting with DoxaPy 0.9.4, Python 3.12 and above are supported with full ABI compatibility. This means that new versions of DoxaPy will only be published due to feature enhancements, not Python version support.

**Local Test Setup**
```
clone https://github.com/brandonmpetty/Doxa
cd Doxa/Bindings/Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python copy-cpp-files.py
cmake -S . -B ./build
cmake --build ./build --config Release
python test/test_doxa.py
```

**Local Package Build**
```
python -m build
```
