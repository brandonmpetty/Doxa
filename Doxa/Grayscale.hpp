{
	/// <summary>
	/// This entire class was greatly influenced by the Color-to-Grayscale article written by Christopher Kanan and 
	/// Garrison W. Cottrell.
	/// 
	/// With the PNM input format, despite the Ref 709 gamma correction scheme specified, there are many variants.
	/// The most important aspect to know, however, is not  the format of sRBG, 601, 709, etc, but if gamma correction
	/// has been applied in the first place.  Reading in a PNM color image, one should assume it is gamma corrected.
	/// 
	/// The top 2 grayscale formulas found by Kanan and Cottrell are Gleam and Intensity'.
	/// The great news is that these share the same formula which is very fast, referred to here as Mean(...).
	/// The bad news is that if you are given a Linear RGB set, your Intensity' is now just Intensity and drops you
	/// from 2nd place to 8th.  Luckily, for color images, you should safely assume you are recieving gamma corrected
	/// RGB values.
	/// 
	/// Because we should assume some form of gamma correction, we are also far more likely to get the result of Luma
	/// than Luminance (exact formula isn't as important), which should be reassuring as that would be a drop from 5th
	/// 10th.  But to show the power of correctly controlling your gamma conversion, if one applied that same formula to
	/// to Linear RGB values and then gamma corrected after the fact, you end up with the 3rd place finisher, Luminance'.
	/// Basically the same formula can take you from 3rd to 10th place, simply due to gamma correction!
	/// 
	/// It is therefore this naieve author's opinion that as long as you start with gamma corrected RGB values, you
	/// should be set regardless of your exact gamma compression scheme, or grayscale conversion formula you want to try.
	/// It is also recommended that when you finally do convert to Grayscale, that you apply your image processing 
	/// algorithms to an uncompressed, linear, grayscale image.
	/// 
	/// Also see:
